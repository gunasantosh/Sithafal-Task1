# PDF Query RAG (Retrieve and Generate)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for querying Unstructured PDF documents using the RAG (Retrieve and Generate) approach. It combines retrieval techniques with generative models to enable efficient and intelligent document analysis and interaction.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text and metadata from PDF files.
- **Information Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant sections of the document based on user queries.
- **Generative Response**: Leverages generative AI models to provide meaningful and context-aware answers.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Easily adaptable for specific use cases or additional features.

## Example Queries

- "Summarize the key points from the document."
- "What does section X discuss?"
- "Find details about topic Y."

## Limitations

- The quality of responses depends on the structure and clarity of the PDF.
- Generative outputs might include hallucinated information if not carefully validated.
